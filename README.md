# SRC-Hunting
Some tools for src bug hunting,made by a salt fish.🐟
And I'm learning how to make some effective tools.
## How to use EDU-domain-crawler.py
git clone this repo
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python EDU-domain-crawler.py
```
and copy the results in a file,then use it to a bug scaner.

**TODO: load the results into a file**
## next tools... maybe oneday.
